    % Centroids is a nx2 matrix, where (i,1) and (i,2) represent the ith
    % agent's centroid's x and y value, respectively.
    % agentPositions is nx2 matrix, where (i,1) and (i,2) is the ith's
    % agent's x and y position, respectively.
    %
    % MOVEMENTSCALE must be greater than 0 and should be less than 2. It is
    % the fraction of the distance that an agent will travel in the x and y
    % direction. For example, if it is 1 then the agent will move to its
    % desired point in one iteration. If it is 0.5 the agent will be halfway
    % there.
    %
    % Velocity is the constant velocity at which the user wishes the agent to
    % travel.
    %

    % converge the fastest, but for the purposes of this project having a
    % MOVEMENTSCALE greater than 1 may be unrealistic.
